# Free Particle in a Box Simulation with ASCII Art of a Cat

This Java program simulates a free particle confined to a one-dimensional box and calculates its energy eigenvalues based on the Schrödinger equation. It also includes an ASCII art representation of a cat and a box for visual appeal.

## Overview

The program solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box with no external potential. It calculates the energy eigenvalues and prints ASCII art of a cat and a box for fun.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   javac FreeParticleInBox.java
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   java FreeParticleInBox
   ```

3. **Follow the Instructions:**
   Enter the quantum number `n` when prompted.

4. **View the Results:**
   The program will display the calculated energy eigenvalue `E_n` and the ASCII art of a cat and a box.
